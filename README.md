## Introducing Penumbra. A truly uncensorable DEX.

Penumbra is a <a href="https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno">Haveno's</a> fork that is strongly aligned with the values of decentralisation, privacy and censorship resistance.

Main differences from Haveno
- True non-custodial trades. In contrast to Havenos 2/3 multisig, [Penumbra uses 2/2 multisig](https://gitlab.com/l0nelyc0w/penumbra/-/tree/penumbra-master/docs/new_protocol.pdf) without arbitration in case "something goes wrong".
- No council and shadow entities. There are no hidden people that you have never heard about influencing this project and its decisions.
