## Introducing Penumbra. A truly uncensorable DEX.
<p>
<img style="float: right;" src="https://gitlab.com/l0nelyc0w/penumbra/-/raw/penumbra-master/desktop/src/main/resources/images/logo_splash.png">
Penumbra is a <a href="https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno">Haveno's</a> fork that is strongly aligned with the values of decentralisation, privacy and censorship resistance.
</p>

An illustration of how Penumbra will operate as a DEX can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/l0nelyc0w/penumbra/-/design_management/designs/431134/12effd1d1ee0bc5a8e50843b2c9b174d9d630164/resized_image/v432x230).

### Features
- **True** non-custodial trades. In contrast to Havenos 2/3 multisig, [Penumbra uses 2/2 multisig](https://gitlab.com/l0nelyc0w/penumbra/-/tree/penumbra-master/docs/new_protocol.pdf) without arbitration.
- No council and shadow entities. There are no hidden people that you have never heard about influencing this project and its decisions.
- No dev tax. Trade fees profit the respective operator on which the offer was posted instead.
- Operators can join the network. See "Requirements for Operators" (TBA)
- Strictly bounty driven development.
